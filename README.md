1. Smorse: Encodes a message with morse code.
2. Decode: Decodes a morse code message.
3. File calculator: Calculates the size of all files on your computer (excludes node_modules, Library, venv, opt). Three methods of calculating: recursively, using threads, using multithreading.
4. Mandelbrot: Generates a Mandelbrot image.

NOTE: Multithreading in file calculator may not be working as efficiently. The first thread exits very early on. I will have to debug this.
